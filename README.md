# Welcome

Welcome to the PantherHackers github. Here you will find all PantherHackers related projects that are currently in development. All members of PantherHackers are welcome to participate in the ongoing development of these projects. This repository is dedicated to introducing you to git, github, pull requests (PR), and the expected code standards and approval process of your PRs.

#Where to start

#Pull Request usage, expecations, and approvals
##Usage
The expected workflow for a contribution is as follows(each step has a link to the relevant documentation on how to do each step)

1. [Fork the Repo you want to work on](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) ([or update an already existing fork](https://gist.github.com/CristinaSolana/1885435))
2. Make your changes on a branch other than `master`
  * Try and make the name relevent to the changes
  * Commit your changes often, try and avoid large commits when possible. A good rule of thumb is to think of each commit as a thought (for example `added FOO to BAR logic`), when you finish a concept or thought, commit.
3. [Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
  * Provide a detailed description of what the change is and what is affected
4. Wait for your PR to be approved
  * If your reviewer gives you feedback then all you need to do is make those changes on the same branch as your Pull Request. You do not need to make another Pull Request as the changes will be added to the PR automatically once you push them.
5. [(optional) Once your Pull Request is approved, delete the branch you were working on to avoid clutter](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-branches-in-your-repository/#deleting-branches)
6. [Update your 'master' branch so that it matches the newest version of the original repo.]((https://gist.github.com/CristinaSolana/1885435))

##Expectations and Approvals
Although PantherHackers is a predominantly student organization, we still expect contributions from our members to be high quality. The quality expectations of each individual repo is up to the discretion of the team managing that repo. Please do your best to work with us to keep our code the best quality it can be. Repo Teams maintain the right to deny PRs at our discretion, but feel free to reach out if the explanation given for why your PR was rejected was not clear.

##If you understand the above please do the following:
 1. Fork this Repo
 2. Create a branch name `(your student user_id)-acknowledgment` for example Mo Hijazi would create the branch `mhijazi1-acknowledgment`
 3. Modify this readme and add your First and Last name and the current date to the very bottom of the Acknowledgment section.
 4. Create a Pull Request, in the **extended description** please put your slack name and an email we can best use to contact you
  * [Example of what this should look like](https://github.com/PantherHackers/StartHere/pull/2)
 5. Once your PR is approved, you are then free to contribute to any of the PantherHackers repo, **failure to do so will result in immediate rejection of your PR**
